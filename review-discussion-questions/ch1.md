# Chapter 1 - Review and Discussion Questions

> Why should we doubt that science covers all of human inquiry?

"What branch of science addresses the question of whether or not science covers all of rational inquiry?" "...[W]hether or not science can answer every question is not itself a scientific issue. Questions about the limits of human inquiry and knowledge are philosophical questions."

In other words, humans inquire into things not addressed by science.
