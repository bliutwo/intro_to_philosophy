# Chapter 1 - Review and Discussion Questions

> Why should we doubt that science covers all of human inquiry?

"What branch of science addresses the question of whether or not science covers all of rational inquiry?" "...[W]hether or not science can answer every question is not itself a scientific issue. Questions about the limits of human inquiry and knowledge are philosophical questions."

In other words, humans inquire into things not addressed by science.

> What are some metaphysical issues?

"**Metaphysics** is concerned with the nature of reality. Traditional metaphysical issues include the existence of God and the nature of human free will (assuming we have any). Here are a few metaphysical questions of interest to contemporary philosophers:

- "What is a thing?
- "How are space and time related?
- "Does the past exist? How about the future?
- "How many dimensions does the world have?
- "Are there any entities beyond physical objects (like numbers, properties, and relations)? If so, how are they related to physical objects?"
